Sleep has always been an issue I have been meaning to address (amongst others!). Carolina’s course enlightened me to not only the importance of sleep hygiene, but also how important it is in relation to the hierarchy of health needs. I learned that good sleep has a positive knock on effect with diet, physical health, vitality as well as mental health. It was highly educational, and I learned about facets of sleep that I had never previously considered, such as my chronotype and how habits can impact on the quality of your sleep. Carolina even showed me how to set up my own sleep lab, and how to measure sleep quality using both accessible technology and also subjective experience, which are of equal importance. Most importantly, Carolina is very down to earth, relatable, and  passionate about her profession. She is always on hand to offer advice and support, she clearly loves her subject, and is dedicated to helping others achieve holistic health and wellness. She is totally herself in the educational videos. She is highly relatable, humorous and genuine. I highly recommend taking Carolina's course if sleep is an issue for you.

Taking the Primordial Sleep course meant an important gain in health and professional performance for me. After following the classes, changing habits and adhering to the use of some devices recommended by Carolina Ramuski, I started to sleep the 8 hours recommended for my chronotype (hummingbird), I increased the duration of my REM sleep and my Deep sleep and got to lose 11 kilos in 8 months. I strongly recommend this excellent program for improving sleep quality and quality of life.

"This experience was amazing! Engaging content and a lot of tips and further reading material. Identifying my chronotype - and what works best for me - allowed me to improve my time to sleep. With offices now introducing a better life balance and care for mental health, it would be interesting to have this workshop across businesses - so I would recommend for business, friends, and family."

"I've had  sleeping problems for years and after only one long coaching session with Carolina, I've realized that the base of my problem was psychological and it was related to some childhood traumas that I have. Once she helped me to identify what could be the problem I started paying attention to it and consequently started sleeping better, Thank you for that talk we had Carolina, it's been helping a lot"

''All the content and follow-up I've had during this process was absolutely useful and effective. Each week Carolina brought contents that complemented each other. With small changes in my habits, I improved the quality of my sleep and was able to identify habits that were destroying my sleep and rest time in general. This process is highly recommended''.

''Carolina's Sleeping program was a life-changing experience for me and a few others in my company.
Even though I was coming out of burnout and had enormous sleeping problems when I started the program, I improved my sleep quality drastically after very small changes.
Carolina is a passionate professional who coaches with enthusiasm and attention to detail.
If you care about your employees and their mental health, I highly recommend her!''.
