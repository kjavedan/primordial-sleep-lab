# Understanding the Different Stages of Sleep

Every night when we sleep, our body and mind go through phases. These phases are called **sleep stages**.

There are **4 sleep stages** ‚Äî **3 non-REM** and **1 REM**. These stages are determined based on an analysis of brain activity during sleep, which shows distinct patterns that characterize each stage. These 4 stages make up a **sleep cycle**, and typically, we have **4‚Äì5 sleep cycles each night**.

## üí§ Stage 1

This stage is essentially the ‚Äúdozing off‚Äù stage and is normally quite short, lasting **1 to 5 minutes**.

In this stage:
- The body hasn‚Äôt fully relaxed
- Body and brain activities start to slow
- There may be brief periods of movement (twitching)

It is **very easy to wake someone** at this stage. If undisturbed, they can quickly move to stage 2.

## üò¥ Stage 2

In this stage, the person enters a more subdued state:
- Drop in temperature
- Relaxed muscles
- Slowed breathing and heart rate
- Eye movement stops
- Brain activity shows short bursts that help resist waking

Stage 2:
- Lasts **10‚Äì25 minutes** during the first cycle
- Becomes longer in later cycles
- Makes up about **50% of total sleep time**

## üß† Stage 3 (Deep Sleep)

Also known as **deep sleep** or **delta sleep** or **slow-wave sleep (SWS)**.  
In this stage:
- Muscle tone, breathing, and pulse decrease further
- Brain shows **delta wave** activity
- It‚Äôs very **difficult to wake someone**

Deep sleep is essential for:
- Bodily **recovery and growth**
- **Immune function**
- **Insightful thinking**, **creativity**, and **memory**

Stage 3:
- Lasts **20‚Äì40 minutes** early in the night
- Gets **shorter** as night progresses while REM gets longer

## üåô Stage 4 (REM Sleep)

**REM** = **Rapid Eye Movement**  
In this stage:
- Brain activity **picks up**, nearly matching waking levels
- **Dreaming occurs**
- Body experiences **atonia** ‚Äî temporary muscle paralysis (except breathing and eye muscles)

REM is vital for:
- **Memory**
- **Learning**
- **Creativity**

Details:
- Starts about **90 minutes** after falling asleep
- First REM stage: only a few minutes
- Later REM stages: **up to 1 hour**
- REM makes up about **25%** of total sleep in healthy adults

## üßæ Factors That Affect Sleep Stages

- **Age**:  
  - Newborns: ~50% REM sleep, may enter REM immediately  
  - Elderly: less REM sleep

- **Alcohol and certain drugs**:  
  - Disrupt REM sleep  
  - Alter sleep architecture

- **Sleep disorders**:  
  - Like **sleep apnea** and **restless leg syndrome (RLS)**  
  - Cause frequent awakenings and disrupt healthy cycles

---

## üõ† Why Sleep Stages Matter

Sleep stages are crucial for:
- **Recovery**
- **Repair**
- **Physical, mental, and emotional health**

Lack of **deep** and **REM** sleep can have a major negative impact on overall well-being.

- Keep **consistent sleep and wake times**, even on weekends
