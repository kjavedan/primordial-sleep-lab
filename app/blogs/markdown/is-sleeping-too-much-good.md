# Do You Oversleep?

Oversleeping can seem like a great thing when your schedule allows for it, but this is actually a lot worse for your health and wellness than you might think. Both little sleep and too much sleep are not good for you. The best thing to do for your health is getting a normal amount of sleep, without going too far under or over.  

Oversleeping disrupts your **circadian rhythm** and confuses it. The best thing to do is to get **regular sleep and wake times**, this way your body can adapt and make the best of the sleep you are getting each night.

## Here are some of the more common signs that you are oversleeping:

### üí§ You Always Wake Up Tired

It is normal to be a little tired in the morning, especially when you were woken up by an alarm or you went to sleep a little later than normal. However, there is a difference between being sleepy because you just woke up, and being **exhausted and severely fatigued**.  

People who are oversleeping have similar effects to waking up after not sleeping much at all. It might feel similar to having **jet lag** or a **bad hangover**. When this keeps happening, it is usually a sign that you might be sleeping too much.

### üß† You Have Brain Fog

You might also be oversleeping if you are experiencing **brain fog**. Of course, brain fog can occur from many different situations and conditions, but oversleeping is definitely one of them.  

When you have brain fog, you feel out of it ‚Äî like you're walking around like a zombie, unable to really focus or concentrate.  

There are different levels of brain fog, but typically you just feel like your brain can‚Äôt quite focus on any one thing at a time.

### ü§ï You Wake Up with a Headache

### ‚öñÔ∏è Unusual Weight Gain

Any time you gain weight without changing your diet or habits, it is something you should look into.  

You might be gaining weight for a number of reasons, including medical conditions like **thyroid disease**, so it is not something to ignore.  

However, your weight gain might actually be from **oversleeping**.  
People who sleep too much tend to gain weight due to:
- Lack of energy throughout the day  
- Poor diet  
- Less time spent on physical activity  

Oversleeping can also be linked to **changes in your appetite**, so without realizing it, you might be eating more than usual.

### üòñ Physical Discomfort

Lastly, consider if you have more **body pain** than you used to.  
This might include:
- Arm and shoulder aching  
- Hip pain  
- Leg discomfort  

These types of pains come from:
- Laying in one position for too long  
- Not stretching out your muscles and joints enough  

If the physical pain has come on after you started sleeping more than usual, it is often linked to **oversleeping**.
