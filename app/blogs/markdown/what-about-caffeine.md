# IS CAFFEINE A VILLAIN?

Caffeine is the most abused substance in the world, most people are addicted to it and it's socially acceptable just about everywhere. But caffeine is not ALL bad, it also has benefits.

Caffeine is a strong stimulant, it is in fact classified as a psychoactive substance and it can help you boost strength and endurance. Luckily, caffeine intake in moderation is not linked to any health risks. Caffeine boosts alertness, response time, cognition, and concentration, among other benefits.

## The Problem with Caffeine

The problem with caffeine is mainly the **timing you ingest it** and **the amount you drink**.  
Caffeine does not stay in the bloodstream or the body for long periods of time, and it is generally eliminated within a few hours. However, it has long-lasting effects, and it can take up to **24 hours** for it to exit the body entirely.  
It enters the bloodstream in **15 to 20 minutes** and takes **an hour to reach peak effectiveness**.

Caffeine can also have a negative impact on some people. It can:
- Raise anxiety
- Cause stomach upsets
- Interrupt sleep

Caffeine can minimize **slow-wave sleep** — your deep, restorative sleep — and shorten your overall sleep time.

Since sensitivities differ and tolerance develops, an individual may not notice the effects of caffeine if they've been using it for a long time and are unaware that it's affecting their sleep.

## When Is It Too Much?

Excessive caffeine consumption can be dangerous.  
**Caffeine consumption should be limited to between 250 and 300 milligrams a day** for most people.  
Keep in mind:
- The average cup of coffee is 110ml  
- So **2 to 2.5 cups a day** should be the max

If you drink more than this, it can disrupt your sleep — especially if consumed later in the day.

## Hidden Sources of Caffeine

There are several items with caffeine that you may not be aware of.  
Some of the most noticeable ones are:
- Fizzy drinks  
- Chocolate  

But you may not realize:
- Other drinks contain caffeine that’s sneaked in  
- Some **medications** contain caffeine

Caffeine and sugar sneak in everywhere! **Always check your labels** and **keep your eyes open**!
